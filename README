rspec/shoulda currently cannot handle association testing such as belongs_to, has_many, has_one with MongoMapper. This patch handles testing for belongs_to associations. More code will be added to test other associations. 

Example of rspec testing handled:

describe Story, 'valid' do
  it { should belong_to :user }
end
